## Description

Builder tiers define different levels within the Polymarket Builder program.

Each tier represents a level of activity or contribution, typically based on
attributed trading volume or other performance metrics.

---

## Purpose

- Categorize builders by impact and usage.
- Enable tier-based benefits, visibility, or incentives.
- Encourage higher-quality and higher-volume integrations.

---

## Tier Structure (Conceptual)

Builders are grouped into tiers such as:

- Entry / Starter
- Intermediate
- Advanced / Top

(Exact tier names and thresholds may change over time.)

---

## Tier Criteria

Tier assignment is typically based on:

- Attributed trading volume
- Consistency of activity
- Compliance with program rules

Thresholds are determined by Polymarket and may be updated periodically.

---

## Tier Benefits

Depending on tier, builders may receive:

- Increased visibility on leaderboards
- Access to incentives or rewards
- Priority support or early access to features

---

## Notes

- Tier calculation is automated.
- Builders cannot manually select a tier.
- Tier status may change over time as metrics update.
